// You are given an array(list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.

// Examples:
// strarr = ["tree", "foling", "trashy", "blue", "abcdef", "uvwxyz"], k = 2

// Concatenate the consecutive strings of strarr by 2, we get:

// treefoling   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[0] and strarr[1]
// folingtrashy ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[1] and strarr[2]
// trashyblue   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[2] and strarr[3]
// blueabcdef   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[3] and strarr[4]
// abcdefuvwxyz ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[4] and strarr[5]

// Two strings are the longest: "folingtrashy" and "abcdefuvwxyz".
// The first that came is "folingtrashy" so 
// longest_consec(strarr, 2) should return "folingtrashy".

// In the same way:
// longest_consec(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas", "theta", "abigail"], 2) --> "abigailtheta"
// n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "" (return Nothing in Elm, "nothing" in Erlang).

function longestConsec(strarr, k) {
    if(k <= 0) return ""
    if(k >= strarr.length) return ""
    let strings = []
    for(let i = 0; i < strarr.length; i++) {
      let chunk = strarr.slice(i, i+k).join('')
      strings.push(chunk)
    }
    let counts = strings.map(el => el.length)
    let longest = counts.indexOf(Math.max(...counts))
    return strings[longest]

//   Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

// As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

// So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

// [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
// But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

// [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
// Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

// Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

function tribonacci(signature,n){
  let res = []
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(i < 3) {
      res.push(signature[i])
      continue
    }
    let val = res.slice(i-3, i).reduce((acc,el) => acc + el)
    res.push(val)
  }
  return res
}
