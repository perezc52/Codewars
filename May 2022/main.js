// Examples
// 'a' and 'g' returns 1

// The BOPE is the squad of special forces of police that usually handles the operations in the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

// In this Kata you have to write a function that determine the number of magazines that every soldier has to have in his bag.

// You will receive the weapon and the number of streets that they have to cross. Considering that every street the officer shoots 3 times. Bellow there is the relation of weapons:

// PT92 - 17 bullets
// M4A1 - 30 bullets
// M16A2 - 30 bullets
// PSG1 - 5 bullets

// Example:

// ["PT92", 6] => 2 (6 streets 3 bullets each)
// ["M4A1", 6] => 1

// The return Will always be an integer so as the params.

function magNumber(info){
  const totalBullets = info[1] * 3;
  if(info[0] === 'PT92') {
    return Math.ceil(totalBullets / 17);

// Issue
// Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again.

// The pipes connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.

// Pipes list is correct when each pipe after the first index is greater (+1) than the previous one, and that there is no duplicates.

// Task
// Given the a list of numbers, return a fixed list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).

// Example
// Input: 1,3,5,6,7,8 Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

function pipeFix(numbers){
  let first = numbers[0];
  let last = numbers[numbers.length - 1];
  let result = [];
  for(let i = first; i <= last; i++) {
    result.push(i);
  }

// Your boss decided to save money by purchasing some cut-rate optical character recognition software for scanning in the text of old novels to your database. At first it seems to capture words okay, but you quickly notice that it throws in a lot of numbers at random places in the text.

// Examples (input -> output)
// '! !'                 -> '! !'
// '123456789'           -> ''
// 'This looks5 grea8t!' -> 'This looks great!'
// Your harried co-workers are looking to you for a solution to take this garbled text and remove all of the numbers. Your program will take in a string and clean out all numeric characters, and return a string with spacing and special characters ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,? all intact.
